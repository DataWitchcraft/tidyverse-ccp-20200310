## Issues / TO DO

- RStudio ID - describe how to work with that (files, console, basic keyboars shortcuts, maybe distribute cheatsheet?)

### Data visualization

- update facet slides to the new syntax (as on the cheatsheet)
- ggplot now uses a different default palette
- diamonds - density plot: the p1 plot is not defined anywhere
- scales: package viridisLite instead of viridis, scale_colour_viridis_c, scale_colour_viridis_d (already installed with tidyverse) 
- get working directory without the underscore: getwd()

### Data transformation

- new syntax to facets  
- slide 119 may count with using the Rmd examples, it can be quite difficult to do it from the scratch  
- mutate: min_rank() is quite difficult to get  
- we skipped $ and needed it in Rmarkdown

### Report

- they don't know for loop yet
